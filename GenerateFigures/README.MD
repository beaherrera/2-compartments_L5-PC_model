This folder contains the codes used to generate the figures of the paper except for the illustrative figures (Fig. 1 and Fig. 6).

- [fig_fIcurve.m](fig_fIcurve.m) generates Figure 2. Frequency - Input relationship.
- [fig_BACfiringWithExp.m](fig_BACfiringWithExp.m) generates Figure 3. Back-propagating AP activated Ca2+ spike firing.
- [fig_CritFreq.m](fig_CritFreq.m) generates Figure 4. Variation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes occurrence relative to somatic stimulation frequency. 
- [fig_CSD.m](fig_CSD.m) generates Figure 5. LFP reflections of the Dendritic Ca2+-spikes â€“ CSD analysis. 

All figures will be saved in a folder, that is created inside the folder GenerateFigures, called Figures.
